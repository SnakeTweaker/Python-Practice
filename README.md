# Very early and buggy port of the Sonic 2 Spindash, Project is currently on hold due to the ROM corruption.

Known Issues:
-Sprite animation for Spindash is incomplete
-Camera panning on Spindash does not follow Sonic accurately
-Sprite corruption when breaking a monitor, a 1-up monitor will appear instead of the broken monitor sprite
-Sonic "spazzes" out sometimes when on ground that is not level
